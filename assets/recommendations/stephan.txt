I managed Kevin for 4 years and had the pleasure of watching him grow tremendously as a QA Engineering professional. Kevin transitioned from a manual QA Engineer to a full-fledged skilled and productive QA Automation Engineer. Kevin is extremely adept at analyzing product code and filling testing gaps, developing new automated tests at the unit, integration and system levels, and building and maintaining product deployment pipelines. Kevin develops trust and very positive working relationships with team members, enabling him to consistently make positive contributions to team success. I highly recommend him, and would love to work with him again.
