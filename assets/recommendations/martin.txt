When I joined Indeed.com Kevin was in charge of QA for the team's products, as well as the Release Manager. Kevin walked me through how to test each of the projects. When Kevin decided to transfer into a QA Automation Engineer role, I spent a couple of years mentoring him on test automation. Kevin came up to speed quickly on programming and test automation. He did a great job developing integration tests for several different gRPC/protocol buffers and REST API services, which lead to Push on Green, Continuous Deployments for the team. I hope to work with Kevin again in the future, because he definitely raised the bar on quality for the team!
