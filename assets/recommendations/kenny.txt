Kevin and I were fellow May cohort mates at App Academy's Software Engineering bootcamp and I can honestly say Kevin has taken countless times out of his day to help me further my understanding of any lines of code, concepts, etc. I just couldn't understand and helped me better my understanding. Kevin is not only a great individual, but a true team player who is always willing to help those in need without ever expecting anything in return. A truly selfless and highly intelligent individual who I got the pleasure to work with.
